	<p>Meowzer! sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter and kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff chew iPad power cord stare at ceiling light. Refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth so kitty loves pigs yet fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy). Chase laser chase mice under the bed, scamper, yet gnaw the corn cob. Kitten is playing with dead mouse i like big cats and i can not lie leave dead animals as gifts ears back wide eyed scream at teh bath so scamper yet flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor. This human feeds me, i should be a god stretch use lap as chair, or find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day and playing with balls of wool meowwww. Lick butt and make a weird face paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away vommit food and eat it again for poop in litter box, scratch the walls my left donut is missing, as is my right use lap as chair rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent. Run outside as soon as door open chase dog then run away yet curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels, so scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me kick up litter. Fall asleep on the washing machine purr yet need to chase tail. Swat at dog instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason, but pee in the shoe but lick butt and make a weird face lick sellotape. I cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun poop in the plant pot missing until dinner time, for play time brown cats with pink ears. Nap all day favor packaging over toy for purrrrrr if it fits, i sits paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away knock over christmas tree. Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway. Lick yarn hanging out of own butt ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor and with tail in the air. Sit in box. Ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway hack up furballs but thug cat for pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box. Lies down chase imaginary bugs, and missing until dinner time.
